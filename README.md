## About the Project

A **Python3** web app for searching weather.

I used the **Flask** framework and the **Bootstrap** library to create a pleasant graphical interface for the application. 

The application uploades data from public **API** and stores information in a database using the **SQLite** module in Python.

The idea for this app was to create a pleasant and easy way to check out the weather.
